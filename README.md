## Project Name & Idea

#### Doom's Bar

Doom's Bar is a Single-page application built with React, Javascript and CSS, that has educational and entertainment purposes. The app lets you browse through hundreds of cocktail recipes, filter them by base ingredient and to select favourite recipes and save them for later. The project uses "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php" to draw data for the cocktail recipes and Firebase for email/password authentication. Client-side Routing is implemented using the react Router library. I picked the name for the app from my nickname and seeing how I'd like to own a bar someday.. this is almost like a dream comming true. :]

#### Disclaimer: I do not condone underage drinking!

## Project Status & Future Ideas

This project is currently still in development. There are a bunch of ideas left to implement, which will have to be done in my free time due to the deadline approaching.

- Add a custom alert modal component - for messages like: "Cocktail already addded to favourites", etc.
- Add a Cursor buddy component - to add to a more aesthetic appeal to the user experience
- Add a comment section to each cocktail recipe- all users can see comments but only users who are logged in can create/update/delete their owm comments
- Add a saved section in profile page - users can choose to save their favourite recepies session in their account, so it can be loaded whenever they log in (currently only saving favourites in state, available for all users)

## Installation and Setup

#### To run this app you need to :

- Have "node" and "npm" installed.
- Clone this repository.
- run `npm install`
- run `start server`
- visit `localhost:3000`

## Conclusion

This is my first app that i built using react and I must say that I loved working with this technology and plan to continue improving my skills, while developing my other project ideas also using react. I plan to come back to this project in the very near future to implement some of the missing functionality (that I didn't have enough time for before the deadline) and also to improve the current design and feel of the app. Although I am pleased with my work on this project, I can still envision it being much better and I am motivated to continue working on it until I reach that state, where I've implemented all my ideas for this project.
To conclude, I think working on this project for the past few weeks has been very productive, as I learned a lot of new things and got a lot of valuable pratice on writing react code. I will definitely be using react for a lot of my projects from now on!
